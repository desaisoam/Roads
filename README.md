# Roads
 Hi, this is the code I used to map road closures. This code is mainly meant to show you my development process. If you would like to view the final product, please visit this link:https://public.tableau.com/profile/soam.desai#!/vizhome/Book1_16132884786290/Sheet1. Please note that the code will most likely not run on your computer because your computer may be lacking many of the libraries. Also, you need a twitter API key and a HERE maps API key to run the program. Thanks for looking!
